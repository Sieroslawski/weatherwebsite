# Weather website
A full weather website I built to practice interacting with APIs

* ## Current Weather tab
  * Displays detailed information for the day and provides an overview of the next 12 hours

* ## 7 Day Weather tab
  * Displays detailed information for the next 7 days and a written overview of the next 7 days as well

* ## 48 Hour Weather tab
  * Displays the weather for the next 48 hours in 3 hour increments (free API limitation)
